# Identification of limitations

a) My solution will not work well on a transcript which do not meet or satisfy any of the rules used in identifying the speakers in each sentence.<br/>
b) My solution will not work well on transcripts which have names of persons which are not in the knowledgebase of the spacy model I used in my implementation. <br/>
c) My solution will not be efficient on a transcript which do not meet the format "speakerID : utteranceText" for each line.<br/>
